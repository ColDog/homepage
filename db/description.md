I am a software developer currently working at [Musefind](http://musefind.com).

I mostly work on the analytics platform that powers our enterprise clients and our matching algorithms. I also work on front end UI design. I work in Java, PHP, Python, Javascript and love any opportunity to work in Ruby. I am most experienced with Ruby, Python and Javascript, inexperienced but competent in Php and trying really hard recently to build more stuff with Java and loving it so far.

My personal project have included around hacking into Node.js and building Sudoku builder.
